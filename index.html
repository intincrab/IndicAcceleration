  <h2 id="indic-accelerationism">Indic/Accelerationism</h2>
  <p>
    A vision for continued socio-economic leapfrog in India via human
    coordination and technological advancement
  </p>
  <h2 id="preamble">Preamble</h2>
  <p>
    We live in a time of extraordinary potential. Technology, when harnessed
    effectively, can radically transform societies and uplift the quality of
    life for billions. For India, with its unique blend of cultural diversity,
    rich heritage, and untapped human potential, the advent of digital
    transformation holds remarkable promise.
  </p>
  <p>
    &quot;Indic Acceleration&quot; represents our commitment to employ the
    profound power of technology for accelerating India&#39;s progress,
    thereby elevating our society to new heights. It is not only imperative to
    aim to capitalize the potential inherent in current times, but also to do
    it in a manner that is not a mindless copy of playbook of existing models.
    The insights from the past experiences and civilization learnings are to
    be treated as well as the new ideas incorporated towards progress and
    growth in real sense.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our aim is to utilize advancements in artificial intelligence, machine
    learning, blockchain, big data, and other tech innovations to speed up
    India&#39;s socio-economic growth, reduce corruption, streamline the
    judicial system, and encourage overall development.
  </p>
  <h3 id="to-degrow-or-to-accelerate-">To degrow or to accelerate?</h3>
  <p>
    The dichotomy of degrowth vs. accelerationism might be a forced one. What
    we want is to degrow our impact on ecology, while accelerating
    civilization.
  </p>
  <p>
    We need to do so sustainably, and not to serve hedonistic consumerism. We
    need to respect ecology and internalize the &#39;externalities&#39;.
  </p>
  <p>
    We need to do so inclusively, with as much federated ownership of capital
    as possible. Either bring the rate of return parity between labour and
    capital; or allow labour to translate to capital ownership as early as
    possible.
  </p>
  <p>
    We need to better velocity of money for sponsoring more opportunities to
    turn labour into inclusive capital, sustainably, avoiding the trap of
    consumerism.
  </p>
  <p>
    We need to free the free markets from the clutches of crony consumerists -
    sometimes masquerading as central planners, other times as sales and
    marketing professionals. More transparency and accountability.
  </p>
  <p>
    We need to respect the uncertainty of complexity and have simpler,
    interoperable heuristics for human coordination and consensus.
  </p>
  <p>
    Political will and technocratic infrastructure for any policy are like
    chicken and egg. One can manifest the other in existence for real change.
    Managing that change is equally crucial.
  </p>
  <p>
    Build upon the philosophy of
    <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/IndiaStack?src=hashtag_click"
      >#IndiaStack</a
    >, Digital Public Infrastructures (DPI), Interchain/Cosmos, Complexity
    Economics, and Doughnut Ecological Economics. We live in a time of
    extraordinary potential. Technology, when harnessed effectively, can
    radically transform societies and uplift the quality of life for billions.
    For India, with its unique blend of cultural diversity, rich heritage, and
    untapped human potential, the advent of digital transformation holds
    remarkable promise.
  </p>
  <p>
    &quot;Indic Acceleration&quot; represents our commitment to employ the
    profound power of technology &amp; first principles for accelerating
    India&#39;s progress, thereby elevating our society to new heights.
  </p>
  <p>
    India&#39;s market liberalization in 1991 was only the beginning of the
    journey. We as a nation are still grappling with the spaghetti code of
    conduct from the central planner&#39;s era. Refactoring has only just
    begun. Indic acceleration, thus, will also involve research mediation,
    policy advocacy and technocratic solution building.
  </p>
  <p>
    We want to build a fraternity of collaborators &amp; builders. We want to
    contribute towards a more open, interoperable, sovereign, federated,
    inclusive, sustainable, marketable, monetizable infrastructure for capital
    building by human coordination &amp; consensus.
  </p>
  <p>
    Inspired from Bharat G20 2023 motto, we want to Accelerate/One Earth,
    Include/One Family, Sustain/One Future.
  </p>
  <h2 id="mission">Mission</h2>
  <p>
    Accelerate the following metrics as soon and as holistically, inclusively,
    sustainably as possible:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>GDP Growth / Accelerate</li>
    <li>Gini&#39;s Coefficient / Include</li>
    <li>Doughnut Metrics / Sustain</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    In an ideal world, these set of holistic metric should replace the
    significance that is currently enjoyed by just GDP alone. We want align
    national as well as private capacity building towards these
    &#39;north-stars&#39;.
  </p>
  <h2 id="goals">Goals</h2>

  </ul>
  <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
  <p>
    In conclusion, we believe that technology should be seen not just as a
    tool but as a fundamental building block for the future of India. Indic
    Acceleration is our pledge to build an India that is modern, inclusive,
    and sustainable, a nation that balances technological advancements with
    its rich cultural heritage. Our aim is to utilize advancements in
    artificial intelligence, machine learning, blockchain, big data, and other
    tech innovations to speed up India&#39;s socioeconomic growth, reduce
    corruption, streamline the judicial system, and encourage overall
    development. This is our manifesto for an enlightened and empowered India,
    an India that leads the world not just in technology, but in wisdom,
    compassion, and progress.

  <h1 id="some-project-ideas">Some Project Ideas</h1>
  <h2 id="i-reducing-corruption">I. Reducing Corruption</h2>
  <p>
    Corruption is a social disease that hinders the healthy growth of any
    nation. We believe that by harnessing the power of blockchain and AI, we
    can inject more transparency and accountability into systems. A
    decentralized, transparent digital ledger can help track and validate
    transactions, making bribery and fraud significantly more difficult. AI
    can be used to analyze patterns and predict potential fraud before it
    occurs.
  </p>
  <h2 id="ii-accelerating-civilization">II. Accelerating Civilization</h2>
  <p>
    To harness the potential of our civilization, we will integrate digital
    technology into every aspect of life. This will include education,
    healthcare, agriculture, infrastructure, and energy. We aim to create a
    digital-first society where access to information and services is
    democratized, enhancing overall productivity and facilitating India&#39;s
    leap into a digitally empowered future.
  </p>
  <h2 id="iii-ai-in-judiciary">III. AI in Judiciary</h2>
  <p>
    The Indian judicial system, burdened by a vast backlog of cases, is in
    desperate need of a revamp. Leveraging AI in judiciary can help expedite
    legal proceedings, reduce manual workload, and offer a more efficient
    system, thus helping set up a robust mechanism for protecting civil rights
    of all Indians.
  </p>
  <p>
    Digitization efforts have
    <a href="https://pib.gov.in/PressReleaseIframePage.aspx?PRID=1896034"
      >accelerated recently</a
    >, including case information software, national judicial data grid, and
    e-filing of case documents. An AI-driven system trained with these
    digitized case history and judgement documents can help strengthen
    jurisprudence (prevent different courts giving contradictory judgements in
    similar cases), analyze legal documents swiftly, sort and prioritize
    cases, and even offer decision-making support. Irrefutable facts like
    proof of provenance can be managed in a tamper proof, decentralized
    digital ledger.
  </p>
  <h2 id="iv-education-and-skill-development">
    IV. Education and Skill Development
  </h2>
  <p>
    We envisage a future where every Indian, regardless of their
    socio-economic status, has access to quality education. Through digital
    platforms, we can democratize learning and provide equal opportunities for
    everyone. AI-driven personalized learning can help cater to individual
    learning styles, offering a more effective education.
  </p>
  <h2 id="v-smart-infrastructure">V. Smart Infrastructure</h2>
  <p>
    Reducing Infrastructure Corruption: Infrastructure projects often become
    breeding grounds for corruption due to their complex, multifaceted nature
    and lack of transparency. AI-driven monitoring and blockchain technology
    can ensure the full transparency of processes, from tender bidding to
    project completion. This will also enable the early detection of
    anomalies, misappropriation of funds or materials, and other signs of
    corruption.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Intelligent Transportation Systems</strong> Leveraging AI, we
        aim to optimize road usage, reducing congestion and improving safety.
        Real-time data analysis can aid in traffic management, predictive
        maintenance, and accident prevention. Connected and autonomous
        vehicles can further streamline transport, leading to fewer accidents
        and more efficient use of roads.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Smart Tolls</strong> Automated toll collection systems powered
        by AI and IoT can streamline toll operations, reducing wait times, and
        improving efficiency. These systems can also prevent revenue leakage,
        ensuring that all funds collected contribute to the maintenance and
        improvement of the roadways.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Predictive Maintenance</strong> AI can help monitor
        infrastructure, predicting potential faults before they lead to costly
        repairs or dangerous failures. For instance, sensors placed on roads,
        bridges, and buildings can provide data to AI models that predict when
        maintenance will be required, extending the life of these structures,
        and improving public safety.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Healthcare</strong> With a median age of 28.2, India has a
        relatively young population. Despite this, the country&#39;s
        healthcare infrastructure remains in a nascent stage and is largely
        inadequate. India has only 0.7 physicians, 1.7 nurses, and 0.5
        hospital beds per 1,000 people. In contrast, China, a country with a
        similar population size, boasts 2.2 physicians, 3.1 nurses, and 4.3
        hospital beds per 1,000 people.
      </p>
      <p>
        This disparity highlights a significant opportunity to build in
        various aspects of healthcare which include preventive healthcare such
        as better diagnostic tools, promoting a fitness-oriented
        lifestyle(better fitness trackers), and critically, improving the
        current non-existent healthcare infrastructure(better med/nursing
        schools, hospitals, better and more equipements).
